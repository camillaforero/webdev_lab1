  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Camilla Forero and I am a senior at Jones College Prep.</p>
  <p>My favorite animals are penguins and cats. My favorite species of penguins are Magellanic Penguins, plus they are from Argentina - where I'm from!</p>
  <p>I just turned 17 on August 21.</p>
